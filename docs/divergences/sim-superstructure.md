# rw-sim divergences: the superstructure (D35, D36)

Fifth file of the `rw-sim` divergences. IDs are global. D35 (the projector family) is step
10a's; D36 (the electric fixtures) is step 10b's.

## D36: Electric fixtures (`SSLightRod`, `ZapCoil`, `ZapCoilLight`, `SuperStructureFuses`)

Five Pebbles' electric placed objects (`rw_sim::ss_light_rod`, `zap_coil`, `ss_fuses`,
`game_ss_electric`; they live in `RoomFixtures`; sprites `rw_graphics::ss_electric`; the
`CustomDepth`, `FlareBomb` and `FlatLight` shaders already existed; MCP `light_rods`,
`zap_coils`, `zap_coil_lights`, `zap_flashes`, `fuses`). Every shared-stream draw is
ported in the game's order, with draw-count and order tests: a rod's vessels draw 3 each
when made and 2 on each wrap; a coil's quiet tick draws 8, a zap 3 or more plus its sound;
a fuse grid draws one for the lightness, four or more for each cell and one for the
malfunction roll, while a camera sees it. The kill is the game's `Creature.Die` through the
port's creature death paths (D33's route for `ElectricDeath`). Notes:
`../../rainworld-re/notes/superstructure-electric.md`.

- **A `ZapFlash`'s sprites draw on the cosmetic stream (D1).** Its seven draws a frame (four
  before its light exists) and the hard-set of its light happen in the app's draw path
  (`App::ss_electric_draw_lists`), which runs before the lights draw, as the game's
  `drawableObjects` order has the flash before the light it makes. Like every cosmetic draw
  they are not interleaved with the other drawables' in the game's order; they are made in
  the app's list order.
- **`DepthAtCoordinate` without a camera picture is the sky (1).** `SSLightRod` samples
  camera 0's level image; the port reads the picture the app hands the sim (`CameraImage`);
  before the first one exists every sample reaches any depth.
- **An arena session is `!story`.** `SuperStructureFuses`' `broken` (the `CorruptionSpores`
  amount; outside an arena session in a region other than `SS` and `UW`, 1) takes the arena
  branch in dev starts (`load_room`, `--room`) too, as `Rainbow` does (D26). A dev start in
  `SL_*` or `SI_*` therefore keeps the room's amount where a story run has 1.
- **`AIMapReady` runs in the loading step.** A `ZapCoilLight` finds its coil (the first
  `ZapCoil` in the update list whose rectangle holds the light) as the room finishes
  loading, after every placed object exists.
- **An unpowered `ZapCoil` in a `BrokenZeroG` room needs the world's switch.** The
  condition reads `rainCycle.brokenAntiGrav`; a room with `BrokenZeroG` makes it, so the
  missing-switch case (a null reference in the game) reads as "not settled".
- **Only the bodies the port realizes are zapped:** the player, bat flies, lizards,
  overseers, rocks and spears (the room's `physicalObjects` the port has). Other
  creatures and items come with their ports.
- **Omitted DLC and Remix branches** (listed, not dropped): More Slugcats' region colours of
  an `SSLightRod`'s lights (`DM`, `MS`, `LM`, `SL`; `SB`) and its `DrawSprites` fog mix;
  `ZapCoil`'s `powered = false` in `MS` without Moon's heart and `ZapCoilLight`'s dark `MS`
  branch; Watcher's exemption of `BoxWorm` and `FireSprite` from the zap; the
  `ElectricSpear.Recharge` (DLCShared); the other readers of `room.zapCoils`: the Saint tongue
  (`Player.Tongue`), `TubeWorm`, `ElectricSpear`, the `Inspector` and its AI, Watcher's
  `ARZapper` (`SSLightRod` lights) and `WarpTear`; Moon's `SLOracleBehavior.fuses`; Remix's
  `ModManager.MMF` test of `brokenAntiGrav != null` in `Room.ElectricPower` (D34); the
  filtration power in it.
- **Developer tools only:** an `SSLightRod` rebuilds its lights when its data's length
  changes (`UpdateLightAmount`), and a fuse grid's `debugMode` colours show when its object
  is moved: the data never changes in the port, the colours are drawn for `debugMode > 0`
  as the game does.
- **Not here:** `DeepProcessing` and `DeepProcessingLight` (step 10c, with the screen grab).
